## Blowy-Up (June and July)
### About
After starting Frostbite, I wanted to make a trigger that allowed destructible environments to be made in it. I made it, but back-ported it to Doom since at the time FB didn't have any sprites. I made a small test map to show off the trigger, I called it "Blowy-Up cave." After a while, the test map turned into a actual map. 

### Files
| File | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| boomtest.wad | The map itself. |
| BlowyUpTest.pk3 | Standalone version of BlowyUp that can be used in other projects |
| BlowyUp.pk3 | Has BlowyUp, as well as code for the map. |

### README
  >"This is an example PK3 for the Blowy Up trick as well as other tricks.
  Originally all of the actors were writen in Decorate (which you can view in OLDCODE), then converted to ZScript. 
  If you need any help with my code, please contact me."



### Cluster text
   > "As Doomguy exited the cave. Something was up.",
   "A opened bag of chips was on a crate near the exit.",
   "Doomguy picked up the bag, realizing that nothing",
   "was in it. Someone must have ate the chips.",
   "It was weird. No one was around, who ate these?"
   "Maybe, someone got 'Lucky.'"

Yeah you can tell I was still in the Lucky phase when making this.

### Fun stuff
- The MIDI that plays in the map is from the Blood Alpha.
- Despite the fact I said the DECORATE code for Blowy-Up wouldn't be updated after I converted it into ZScript, I ended up using and updating it for newer verisons of Spider's Delight, Frostbite, and a secret project Glacier is making.
>"This the old Decorate code for Blowy Up and the other stuff. 
This has not been updated with the ZScript one.
AKA, DON'T USE!!!" - OLDCODE

## August-November
The start of SD's main development. During a Amy Rose phase (cringe phase), I had a idea for a [Death Wish](https://www.moddb.com/mods/death-wish-for-blood)-like  map pack for Doom. The name comes from a boss in a old Doom 2016 SnapMap I made years ago. 

### Files
### Main root
| File | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| Stuff.pk3 | The main PK3 for the maps. |
### BrokenPK3s
| File | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| All of the files | Corrupted PK3s. Most of the code I wrote for them is lost, as I didn't keep backups. Most of the code in **Stuff.pk3** is not the original code, it was reverse-engineered for this archive. |

### Maps
| File | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| SD1.wad | Oops , all slime! Very inspired from the original BlowyUp map. Even has it copied and pasted in it. I scrapped it because starting your map pack in a brown cave is not really a good idea. |
| SDDM1.wad | Remake of [Bodies](https://blood-wiki.org/index.php?title=BB3:_Bodies) from Blood, but set in a cave. |
| HHDYWI.wad | The difficulty selection map, like in Quake. |

### Maps\Oldvers
| File | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| Stuff1.wad and Stuff2.wad | Old verisons of Oops , all slime! |
| MAP01.wad | Very unfinished bedroom. |

## OTEX (May)
In May, I decided to change the map set, it was going to use ukiro's OTEX texture pack. It didn't get so far.

NOTE, you will need to download OTEX from ukiro's website to view this map. I mean, you can load it without it, but it will look like shit.
[Download OTEX](https://doom.ukiro.com/about-otex/)

### Files
| File | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| NEW_HHDYWI.wad | The new version. Only has a puzzle to access Nightmare difficulty. |

### (Not so) Fun stuff
- The quote when you walk in the Nightmare room, "A heart of gold stopped beating, two willing hands at rest, God broke our hearts to prove to us he only takes the best.", is a fairly common verse to see on stuff like headstones.
